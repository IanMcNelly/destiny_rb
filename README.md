# DestinyRb

Welcome to Destiny_rb! This is a lightweight Ruby wrapper for Bungies Destiny API. Currently it is only focused on anonymous API calls, so no endpoints that require a XBL/PSN sign-in will be supported. More to come on that in the future!

If you are a Slack user feel free to check out [lita-destiny], a Lita handler that spawned this gem!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'destiny_rb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install destiny_rb

## Usage

Please refer to the [documentation].

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org].
